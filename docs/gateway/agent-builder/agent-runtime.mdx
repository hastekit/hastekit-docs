title: Agent Runtime
---

The Runtime setting determines how the agent executes and handles failures.

## Runtime Types

### Local

Runs everything in the same process as the request handler. This is the simplest runtime with no external dependencies.

**Characteristics:**
- Fast execution with no network overhead
- Crashes during the agent loop cannot recover
- Suitable for development and low-risk scenarios

### Restate

Uses Restate server for durable execution. Each agent loop runs as a Restate workflow, and each IO operation is a Restate durable step.

**Characteristics:**
- Durable execution with automatic recovery
- IO operation results are stored by Restate and reused upon recovery/replay instead of performing the operation again
- Provides strong guarantees for long-running agent operations
- Streaming is handled through sidecar Redis-based streaming
- Suitable for production environments requiring reliability

### Temporal

Uses Temporal server for durable execution. Each agent loop runs as a Temporal workflow, and each IO operation is a Temporal activity.

**Characteristics:**
- Durable execution with automatic recovery
- IO operations are executed as Temporal activities, providing isolation and retry capabilities
- Streaming is handled through sidecar Redis-based streaming
- Suitable for production environments requiring workflow orchestration
