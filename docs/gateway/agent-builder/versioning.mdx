title: Versioning

Agents are automatically versioned. Each time you update an agent configuration, a new version is created.

## Version Management

- **Version 0** - Represents the latest version ($LATEST)
- **Version Numbers** - Increment automatically with each configuration change
- **Version History** - All previous versions are retained for rollback and comparison

Versions allow you to:
- Track configuration changes over time
- Roll back to previous configurations
- Reference specific versions via aliases
