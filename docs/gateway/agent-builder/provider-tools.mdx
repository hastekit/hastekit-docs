Provider tools are capabilities provided directly by the model providers that can be enabled for your agents. These tools allow your agents to perform specialized tasks like generating images, searching the web, and executing code.

## Overview

The Agent Builder provides access to three tools that leverage the native capabilities of supported LLM providers:

- **Image Generation Tool** - Generate images from text descriptions
- **Web Search Tool** - Search the web for real-time information
- **Code Execution Tool** - Execute code in a sandboxed environment

These tools are automatically handled by the model providers when enabled, requiring no additional configuration or setup.

## Enabling Provider Tools

To enable provider tools for your agent:

1. Navigate to your agent in the Agent Builder
2. Click on the **Tools** tab
3. Toggle the switch next to each tool you want to enable
4. Save your agent configuration

Each tool can be enabled or disabled independently. When enabled, the agent will have access to that tool's capabilities during conversations.
