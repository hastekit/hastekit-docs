title: Multi-Agent Handoffs
description: Configure an agent to hand off conversations to other agents
---

Handoffs enable an agent to transfer control of a conversation to another agent. Unlike [Agent as a Tool](/gateway/agent-builder/agent-tool) where the parent agent calls sub-agents and continues processing, handoffs transfer control entirely to the target agent, which then responds directly to the user.

## Overview

The **Handoffs** feature lets you:

- Configure agents that can receive handoffs from the current agent
- Build router patterns where a central agent delegates to specialists
- Share conversation context when handing off
- Pin each handoff target to a specific version or use **$LATEST**
- Add descriptions to help the model decide when to hand off

Only agents in the same project are listed. The current agent is excluded so you cannot add an agent as a handoff target to itself.

## Handoffs vs Agent as a Tool

| Feature | Handoffs | Agent as a Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Control flow** | Transfers control entirely to target agent | Parent agent continues after sub-agent returns |
| **Response** | Target agent responds directly to user | Sub-agent result returned to parent agent |
| **Conversation history** | Shared with target agent | Sub-agent runs without history |
| **Use case** | Router patterns, specialist delegation | Tool-like sub-tasks, parallel processing |

## Runtime Behavior

When an agent hands off to another agent:

- **Shared history** – The target agent receives the conversation history, providing continuity for the user.
- **Direct response** – The target agent's response goes directly to the user; the original agent does not process it further.
- **Full transfer** – Control is transferred to the handoff target; the original agent's run ends.

## Configuring Handoffs

1. Open your agent in the Agent Builder and go to the **Handoffs** tab.
2. Click **Add Handoff** to add a new handoff target.
3. For each handoff entry:
   - **Agent** – Select the target agent from the dropdown (other agents in the project; current agent is excluded).
   - **Version** – Choose **$LATEST** (always use the latest version) or a specific version.
   - **Description** – Optional but recommended. Describe when this handoff should be used; this helps the model decide when to hand off.
4. Add more handoffs by clicking **Add Handoff** again.
5. Remove a handoff with the delete (trash) icon on its row.
6. Save your agent configuration.

You can add multiple handoff targets. The model will choose the appropriate target based on the descriptions you provide.
