title: Conversing with the Agent
---

The chat interface allows you to interact with your agents through a conversational interface.

## Interface Overview

The chat interface consists of:

- **Sidebar** - Lists all your conversations
- **Main Chat Area** - Displays messages and agent responses
- **Input Bar** - Agent selection, version selection, context configuration, and message input

## Selecting an Agent

Click the agent name button above the input field to open the agent selection menu. Choose the agent you want to converse with.

## Selecting Agent Version

Click the **Latest** button to select a specific agent version. The menu shows all available versions for the selected agent. Version 0 represents the latest version.

## Adding Context

Click the **@** button to open the "Add Context" dialog. This allows you to provide additional context and headers that will be sent with each message.

### Context

JSON object containing additional context data to pass to the agent. This can include user information, session data, or any custom context your agent needs.

### Headers

JSON object containing HTTP headers to include with the request. Useful for authentication tokens, custom headers, or metadata.

Both context and headers are edited in JSON format using the code editor. The values persist across messages in the same session.

## Sending Messages

Type your message in the "Ask anything" input field and press Enter or click the send button. The agent will process your message and stream the response in real-time.

## Conversation Management

### Starting a New Chat

Click **New Chat** in the sidebar to start a fresh conversation. This creates a new conversation thread without previous context (unless conversation history is enabled for the agent).

### Viewing Past Conversations

All your conversations are listed in the sidebar under "Chats". Click any conversation to resume it. The agent will have access to the conversation history if history is enabled.
