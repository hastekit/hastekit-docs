title: Agent as a Tool
description: Configure an agent to use another agent as a tool
---

Use other agents in the same project as callable tools. When enabled, the main agent can invoke the selected agent(s) as tools during a run, letting you compose agents (e.g., a planner that delegates to specialist agents).

## Overview

The **Agent as a Tool** feature lets you:

- Choose one or more agents from the same project to act as tools
- Pin each tool to a specific version or use **$LATEST**
- Optionally add a description so the model knows when to use the tool

Only agents in the same project are listed. The current agent is excluded so you cannot add an agent as a tool to itself.

## Runtime behavior

When the main agent calls an agent tool:

- **No history** – The sub-agent runs without conversation history; each call is a fresh run with only the inputs passed for that tool call.
- **No streaming** – Intermediate outputs from the sub-agent are not streamed. Only the **final output** is returned to the main agent as the tool call result.

## Configuring Agent as a Tool

1. Open your agent in the Agent Builder and go to the **Tools** tab.
2. In the **Agent as a Tool** section, click **Add Agent Tool**.
3. For each tool entry:
   - **Agent** – Select the agent from the dropdown (other agents in the project; current agent is excluded).
   - **Version** – Choose **$LATEST** (always use the latest version) or a specific version.
   - **Description** – Optional. Describe what this agent tool does; this is shown to the model when the tool is available and can help it decide when to call the tool.
4. Add more tools by clicking **Add Agent Tool** again.
5. Remove a tool with the delete (trash) icon on its row.
6. Save your agent configuration.

You can add multiple agents as tools. Each entry is an independent tool the main agent can call.
