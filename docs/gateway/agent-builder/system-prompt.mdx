Configure the system prompt that defines your agent's behavior and instructions.

## Prompt Options

You can configure the system prompt in two ways:

### Use Prompt Reference

Reference a saved prompt from your prompt library:

1. Click **Use Prompt Reference**
2. Select a prompt from the **Select Prompt** dropdown

**Important:** Each prompt version is immutable. When you reference a prompt, you're referencing a specific version that will not change, ensuring consistent agent behavior even if the prompt is updated later.

### Use Raw Prompt Text

Enter the prompt text directly:

1. Click **Use Raw Prompt Text**
2. Enter your system prompt in the text editor

The editor supports multi-line text and provides syntax highlighting for better readability.
