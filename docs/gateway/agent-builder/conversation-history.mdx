title: Conversation History
---

Configure whether the agent maintains conversation history across interactions and how to manage long conversations.

## Configuration

**Enable Conversation History** - Toggle switch to enable or disable conversation history.

When enabled, the agent will:
- Store conversation messages
- Use previous context in subsequent interactions
- Maintain state across multiple conversation turns

When disabled, each interaction is treated as a new conversation without context from previous messages.

## Summarization

When conversation history is enabled, you can configure summarization to manage long conversations and reduce token usage.

### LLM-Based Summarization

Uses an LLM to intelligently summarize older conversation history while preserving important context.

**Configuration:**
- **Summarizer Model** - LLM provider and model for summarization
- **Summarizer Prompt** - Instructions for how to summarize conversations
- **Token Threshold** - Summarization triggers when total tokens exceed this value
- **Keep Recent Count** - Number of recent conversation runs to keep unsummarized

**How it works:**
- Monitors total token count in conversation history
- When threshold is exceeded, keeps the most recent N runs intact
- Summarizes older runs into a single system message
- Preserves important context while reducing token usage

### Sliding Window Summarization

Keeps only the most recent N conversation runs and discards older ones. This is a simple, cost-effective approach that doesn't require an LLM.

**Configuration:**
- **Keep Count** - Number of recent conversation runs to retain

**How it works:**
- Messages are grouped by conversation run ID
- Only the most recent N runs are kept
- Older runs are discarded without summarization
