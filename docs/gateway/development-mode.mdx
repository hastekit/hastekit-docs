This guide will help you set up Uno LLM Gateway for local development. In development mode, you'll run the backend and frontend locally while using Docker Compose for infrastructure services.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker** - [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Docker Compose** - Usually included with Docker Desktop
- **Node.js 20+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Go 1.25.3+** - [Download Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Verify your installations:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
node --version  # Should be v20.0.0 or higher
go version      # Should be go1.25.3 or higher
```

## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the Uno repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curaious/uno.git
cd uno
```

## 2. Start Infrastructure Services

Start the required infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, etc.) using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f ./deployments/docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

This command starts:
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching layer
- **ClickHouse** - Analytics and telemetry storage
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** - Trace and metrics collection

Verify that all services are running:

```bash
docker compose -f ./deployments/docker-compose.dev.yaml ps
```

## 3. Start the Backend

In the root directory, start the backend server:

```bash
go run main.go agent-server
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:6060`. You should see logs indicating the server is running.

## 4. Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Only needed the first time or after dependency changes
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open in your browser.

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

- **Backend changes**: The Go server will need to be restarted manually after code changes
- **Frontend changes**: The React development server supports hot reloading - changes will appear automatically

### Stopping Services

To stop all services:

```bash
# Stop backend: Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal
# Stop frontend: Press Ctrl+C in the frontend terminal
# Stop infrastructure:
docker compose -f ./deployments/docker-compose.dev.yaml down
```
