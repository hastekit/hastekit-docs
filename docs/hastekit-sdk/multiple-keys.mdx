title: Managing Multiple Keys
---

Uno supports managing multiple API keys for a single provider. This is useful for:
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple API keys to avoid rate limits.
- **Redundancy:** Ensure high availability by having fallback keys.
- **Cost Management:** Allocate traffic based on usage quotas or costs associated with different keys.

## Weighted Random Selection

When multiple API keys with weights are configured for a provider, Uno uses **weighted random selection** to choose which key to use for each request.

Each API key must be assigned a `Weight`. The probability of a key being selected is proportional to its weight relative to the sum of all weights for that provider.

### How it Works

1.  Uno retrieves all enabled API keys for the requested provider.
2.  It extracts the `Weight` from each `APIKeyConfig`.
3.  If multiple keys exist, it performs a weighted random selection.
4.  The request is then executed using the selected API key.

If all keys have the same weight (e.g., all set to `1` or not specified), the selection becomes uniformly random.

## Configuration Example

When using the Uno SDK in direct mode, you can configure multiple keys using the `InMemoryConfigStore`.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/hastekit/hastekit-sdk-go/pkg/gateway"
	"github.com/hastekit/hastekit-sdk-go/pkg/gateway/llm"
	"github.com/hastekit/hastekit-sdk-go"
)

func main() {
	// Define multiple API keys for OpenAI with different weights
	openAIConfig := &gateway.ProviderConfig{
		ProviderName: llm.ProviderNameOpenAI,
		ApiKeys: []*gateway.APIKeyConfig{
			{
				APIKey: "sk-openai-key-1",
				Weight: 70, // This key will be used ~70% of the time
			},
			{
				APIKey: "sk-openai-key-2",
				Weight: 30, // This key will be used ~30% of the time
			},
		},
	}

	// Initialize the config store
	configStore := sdk.NewInMemoryConfigStore([]*gateway.ProviderConfig{openAIConfig})

	// Create the Uno client
	uno, err := sdk.New(&sdk.ClientOptions{
		LLMConfigs: configStore,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to create uno client: %v", err)
	}
}
```
