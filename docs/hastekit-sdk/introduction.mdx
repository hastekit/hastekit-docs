description: A Golang SDK for making LLM calls, building AI agents, and orchestrating complex workflows across multiple providers.

## HasteKit SDK

A Golang SDK for developers who want fine-grained control over LLM interactions and agent orchestration. The HasteKit SDK abstracts away provider differences, letting you switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and more with a single line change. Build agents, connect MCP tools, and get structured outputs—all through a unified API.

### Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-Provider Support" icon="shuffle">
    Access to multiple providers through a unified API. Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent SDK" icon="robot">
    Build sophisticated AI agents with dynamic system instructions, tools, conversation history, summarization, and multi-step reasoning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human-in-the-loop" icon="person">
    Integrate human feedback into agent workflows for review and approval.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Durable Execution" icon="helmet-safety">
    Create durable agents that can pause, resume, and recover from failures.

### Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LLM Calls">
    Use the SDK as a lightweight wrapper to call any LLM provider. Simply change the `Provider` and `Model` to switch between providers—your application logic stays the same:

```go
resp, _ := client.NewResponses(ctx, &responses.Request{
    Model: "OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini", // or "Anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5" or "Gemini/gemini-2.5-flash"
    Instructions: utils.Ptr("You are a helpful assistant."),
    Input: responses.InputUnion{
        OfString: utils.Ptr("What is the capital of France?"),
    },
})
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Agents">
    Create agents with tools, memory, and multi-step reasoning. Agents work the same way across all providers:

```go
agent := client.NewAgent(&hastekit.AgentOptions{
    Name:        "Assistant",
    Instruction: client.Prompt("You are a helpful assistant."),
    LLM: client.NewLLM(hastekit.LLMOptions{
        Provider: llm.ProviderNameOpenAI,
        Model:    "gpt-4o-mini",
    }),
})

out, _ := agent.Execute(ctx, &agents.AgentInput{
    Messages: []responses.InputMessageUnion{
        responses.UserMessage("Hello!"),
    },
})
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
