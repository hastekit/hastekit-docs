Reasoning models (like OpenAI's `o1` and `o3` series) perform internal chain-of-thought processing before generating a final answer. The Uno SDK allows you to configure reasoning parameters and access these reasoning steps.

## Enabling Reasoning

To use reasoning features, you typically need to use a compatible model and configure the `Reasoning` parameters in your request.

```go
resp, err := model.NewResponses(ctx, &responses.Request{
    Input: responses.InputUnion{
        OfString: utils.Ptr("If 2+4=6, what would be 22+44=?"),
    },
    Parameters: responses.Parameters{
        Reasoning: &responses.ReasoningParam{
            Summary: utils.Ptr("detailed"),
        },
		Include: []responses.Includable{
            responses.IncludableReasoningEncryptedContent,
        },
    },
})
```

### Reasoning Output

Reasoning steps are returned as distinct output items, separate from the final text response. You can access them like this:

```go
resp, err := model.NewResponses(ctx, request)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

for _, output := range resp.Output {
    if output.OfReasoning != nil {
        fmt.Println("Reasoning Steps:")
        for _, s := range output.OfReasoning.Summary {
            fmt.Printf("- %s\n", s.Text)
        }
    }
}
```

### Streaming Reasoning

When streaming, reasoning steps are emitted as chunks. You can detect when a reasoning item is completed.

```go
acc := ""
for chunk := range stream {
    if chunk.ChunkType() == "response.reasoning_summary_text.delta" {
		acc += chunk.OfReasoningSummaryTextDelta.Delta
    }
}
```
